# About Me

**Results-driven Manager** with a strong foundation in **Finance and Operations**, now pivoting into **Data Analytics**.

After several years in management, I realized that my most impactful decisions were always rooted in data. My passion for uncovering hidden insights in data led me to evolve my career into a Data Analyst role, combining my management experience with technical skills to solve complex business problems.

I specialize in **bridging the gap between raw data and strategic business decisions**. My strong background in Finance & Accounting gives me a unique advantage: I don't just build dashboards—I ensure the data is accurate and impactful for the business.

I am now seeking an exciting opportunity to transform raw data into actionable insights that tackle real business challenges.
